# 2. Use NeoVim as Editor of Choice

Date: 2021-11-22

## Status

Accepted

## Context

I want to stay in the Command line as much as possible when working with CLI and automation scripting.

## Decision

I will use NeoVim as my primary editor in Linux Command Lines.

## Consequences

I am abandoning any wish to ever use EMACS. My reflexive windows copy paste is slowed down.
